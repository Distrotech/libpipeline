pipeline.

libpipeline 1.1.0 (11 December 2010)

Add `pipecmd_exec' to execute a single command, replacing the current
process; this is analogous to `execvp'.

Add `pipecmd_clearenv' to clear a command's environment; this is analogous
to `clearenv'.

Add `pipecmd_get_nargs' to get the number of arguments to a command.
