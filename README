libpipeline, a pipeline manipulation library
============================================

libpipeline is a C library for setting up and running pipelines of
processes, without needing to involve shell command-line parsing which is
often error-prone and insecure.  This alleviates programmers of the need to
laboriously construct pipelines using lower-level primitives such as fork(2)
and execve(2).

Full programmers' documentation may be found using 'man libpipeline'.

Note on GPL versions
--------------------

(This note is informative, and if it conflicts with the terms of the licence
then the licence is correct.  See the full text of the licence in the
COPYING file for precise details.)

The core source code of libpipeline is licensed under GPL v2 or later.
However, libpipeline incorporates parts of the Gnulib portability library,
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation and others, and much of Gnulib
is distributed under GPL v3 or later.  This means that libpipeline as a
whole falls under the terms of the GPL v3 or later.  Unless you take special
pains to remove the GPL v3 portions, you must therefore follow the terms and
conditions of the GPL v3 or later when distributing libpipeline itself, or
distributing code linked against it.

Note that this does not require that your own source code be licensed under
the GPL v3, contrary to popular misunderstanding.  However, you must be
prepared to distribute your work as a whole under the terms of the GPL v3 or
later, which requires that your licence be compatible with the GPL v3.  See
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses if you
need advice on compatibility.

The GPL mainly restricts distribution ("conveying", in the specific language
of GPL v3), and is careful not to restrict private use.  Therefore, you may
write programs for your own use that use libpipeline without needing to
license them under GPL v3-compatible terms.  If you distribute these
programs to others, then you must take care to use compatible licensing.
